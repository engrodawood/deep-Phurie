DEEP-PHURIE is a hurricane intensity prediction system. It takes infrared (IR) images of hurricanes acquired by satellites as input, and use Deep Learning for feature extraction and predicts the intensity in knots.

Info! (This system accepts files in netcdf(.nc) file format in which IR images are stored in 'IRWIN' variable.). You will be notified about the predicted intensity via email within 10 minutes of submission. make sure that you upload correct file format and correct email address. please also check your spams folder after 10 minutes if you did not receive the email.

Note: The predictions generated by this system are based on a single input IR image alone i.e., no prior or subsequent information is used
